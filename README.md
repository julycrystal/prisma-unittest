# nodejs-prisma-unit-test

The missing demo of unit testing Prisma for nodejs.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

## Prisma Official Guides

They only provide testing guides for `TypeScript`, so I made this `Nodejs` version.

These test cases are equivalent to [Prisma Guides / Testing - Unit testing](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing),
its source file within Git repo for this moment is: [docs/content/300-guides/150-testing/100-unit-testing.mdx](https://github.com/prisma/docs/blob/dba6a061f5a93ea55e3d9ee01d488b14e438c472/content/300-guides/150-testing/100-unit-testing.mdx).
